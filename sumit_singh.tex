    \section{\mysidestyle Current Work}

\textit{Software Engineer on Android Platform - Directi} \\
Time: Feb 14 onwards.\\
Product: Tring - voip client.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item worked in Java, JNI, C, XML with emphasis on good code design.
        \item developed initial prototype alone using pjsip.
        \item worked in a team of 2 for initial 10 months.
	\item a significant amount of time was invested to ensure quality and specifically echo.
	\item we ended up experimenting with lot of voice/media stacks with some tweaks of our own.
	\item experimented with continuous build system and analytics.
	\item currently we send a lot of RTCP stats and user feedback to narrow down and detect possible issues.
	\item for an earlier version of the app, we wrote functional tests that used to test proper call flow and voice flow (no quality test). 
	\item switched from IntelliJ + Ant to Android Studio + Gradle. 
 \end{itemize}

\textit{Software Engineer on Android Platform - Directi} \\
Time: Sep 13 - Jan 14.\\
Product: talk.to - rich text client.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Languages: Java, XML, (occasional Python scripts).
\item Tools: Ant, Android Perfomance tools (e.g. monitor), Java profiler (YJP).
\item Test: Unit testing(junit) and functional testing (android specific).
\item great insights into some of the aspects like reasons for low user onboarding(successful signup) rate, why pivoting the product (did twice when I was there).
\end{itemize}

\textit{Training project at Directi}\\
Time: Jul 13 - Sep 13.

    \section{\mysidestyle M. Tech Thesis}
The thesis was in the area of approximation algorithms under the guidance of Prof. Shashank K Mehta. 
We mostly worked on upper bounds for mainly graph based problems. We were able to improve the state of the art in  the two of the three problems that we looked at (at the time of thesis defence).
